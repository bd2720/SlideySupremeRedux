# SlideySupremeRedux -- V1.1.1 #  
A 2D sliding puzzle of "arbitrary" width and height.  
Successor to my hard-coded 3x3 version from 2019.  
Created with the Processing sketchbook (Java Mode).  
  
Runs in 800x600 or 1280x720 @ 60fps.  
Designed for 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios.  
Supports key controls, but mouse is recommended.  
  
Minimum puzzle size is 2x2, maximum is 31x31.  
Settings and high scores save across playthroughs.  
Please enjoy, and feel free to suggest changes!
